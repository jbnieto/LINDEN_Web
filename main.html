                    <h3>Vision Phase</h3>
                    <p>For simplicity purposes I have broken down the software development
                        lifecycle for the sake of this email into primarily where the consulting practice will be used,
                        the vision phase and the design phase.
                        The point of the consultation within the ESDLC is that the software may need to change requirements
                        along the way and thus a client will not have to invest in a product that may be obsolete in a year.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The vision phase is comprised of your standard business requirements and your initiation of a project</li>
                        <li>This states typically involves a lot of research for both the client and victory.</li>
                        <li>Within this phase the consulting portion will include
                            <ul>
                                <li>Strategic information based on the current market.</li>
                                <li>The market knowledge to include into the requirements working with the client.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Note the above that the actual requirements can be created and gathered by both the client and victory.</p>

                    <h3>Design Phase</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the design phase the consulting practice and the software development practiced are putting
                            together what the actual use cases are. This is mainly due to the fact that although the strategic
                            consulting does look good on paper it has to make it into the actual product to be delivered.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Think of it as although we have consulting on the market the market will have a different
                                    impact on the age group. So things start to trickle down a little more detailed into the
                                    requirements based on several factors. It could be region for example</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Considering that software development is a moving lifecycle and the consulting practice initially
                            will make sense at the beginning. The consulting will also make sense if during the lifecycle if
                            there are legislation and market changes.
                            <ul>
                                <li>For example if a state decides that it will not decide to use the Common Core.
                                    Software may need to be adapted to accommodate.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Analyze and consult on the data that will be collected for VBD.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>“Working with Victory can bring to light the solution you are trying to bring to the market.
                        Our assessment and consulting team will work with you as extension of your team. Not just simply as a solutions provider.”</p>
                    <p>“Not only will Victory bring your product to Market but with VBD Victory will enhance your product
                        through adaptive learning, quality assurance, and the research on the necessary technologies to give you a real advantage in the market place. “</p>
                    <p>“Over the last 13 years Victory has helped companies master business model and technology transitions”</p>
                    <p>“Victory’s spends thousands of consulting and software development hours per month.

                    <p>Victory’s Spanish-speaking assessment team has developed high stakes tests for Puerto Rico’s
                        elementary and secondary students since 2010. Each year’s item bank is correlated to more than
                        1,400 content standards for seven grades in math, science, ESL, and Spanish. Engaged in every
                        stage of production, Victory creates items, original passages, and artwork. The assessment team
                        conducts item-writer workshops, content and bias committees, and data review meetings.</p>

                    <h3>New York State Testing Program</h3>
                    <p>Victory worked with Pearson Assessment to develop rigorous new content to align New York’s
                        high-stakes tests to the Common Core. The purpose of the tests is to prepare students in
                        New York for the PARCC assessments that will be administered in the 2014-2015 school year.
                        Last year (year four of the project), Victory wrote and delivered more than 1,030 ELA passages
                        and items and 900 math items for grades 3 through 11. Victory and Pearson conducted the teacher
                        reviews and evaluation meetings.</p>

                    <p>MITE, known for its innovative online curricula, asked Victory to develop 5,000 adaptive
                        assessment items for their Developmental Math program. In addition, we wrote, edited,
                        and illustrated the program’s culminating trigonometry unit. Victory helped MITE troubleshoot
                        workflow issues in their content management system, including perfecting procedures for art
                        importation and math typesetting.</p>

                    <h3>Technology-Enhanced Items</h3>
                    <p>Victory’s technology genuinely enhances assessment items when it enables
                        students to show greater depth of knowledge or enables the assessment to infer
                        how a student approaches the item. Creating technology-enhanced items requires
                        close collaboration between instructional experts, item writers, and software developers.
                        Victory specializes in integrating these competencies to develop data-rich TEIs
                        for high-stakes summative assessments, formative assessments, and adaptive instruction.
                        These items provide a more complete picture of psychometric constructs and achievement of
                        standards than traditional multiple-choice items. Victory’s TEIs can capture, store, and
                        process student responses in real time.</p>

                    <p>Victory Productions worked with John Conner, a leading voice of language instruction in the
                        United States, to develop an iPad version of his successful Spanish language program. The
                        iBooks Textbooks version of three levels (beginner, intermediate, and advanced) combine dynamic
                        audio, video, and interactive exercises.<br>
                        This product is the first language textbook series in Apple’s iBookstore. John describes it
                        as “revolutionary” and “game-changing,” for teachers and students. Victory also created the
                        animated, interactive product showcase page at Breaking the Barrier’s website.</p>

                        science readers to support FOSS Science Kits, the leading inquiry-based science program in the
                        United States. Victory’s team for science consulted with NSTA while writing, illustrating, and
                        designing 30 leveled readers that align to the Common Core. Each book starts with a puzzle that
                        kids solve as they think about the information presented in a measured, well-planned
                        sequence.</p>

                    <p>Gale Cengage asked Victory to compile data about the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and present
                        them in a variety of media through one Flash-based learning object. Our solution combines
                        graphs of signal indicators, such as the total of shoreline that was despoiled, and a
                        timeline of events related to the spill. The product incorporates video, slideshows, photos,
                        and links to a variety of sources of news media outlets. Student and class activities focus on
                        data analysis, critical thinking, and writing skills.</p>

                    <p>The Virginia Department of Education needed course materials developed to support schools in
                        teaching to a new high school requirement. Victory came to their aid, developing a yearlong
                        course and deploying it online through their statewide LMS. When Apple revealed iBooks
                        Textbooks, Victory leapt to convert the course for use on the iPad, taking full advantage of
                        the format’s interactive capabilities. The resulting pair of iBooks textbooks were the first
                        available on economics and personal finance in the iTunes store.</p>

                        Fifteen of these were aging Java applets in dire need of an electronic facelift.
                        Working with NCTM, Victory’s math editors created even better illustrations of the standards.
                        Our designers and programmers built Flash applets that fit smoothly into their site layout.
                        The reinvigorated applets look friendlier, perform more fluidly and interactively, and include
                        a whole new level of functionality.</p>

                    <h3>Common Core Standards and Strategies</h3>
                    <p>Mentoring Minds, the publisher of a popular series of flipcharts describing Common Core standards,
                        recognized a demand for a similar product in digital form. Victory created an iPad app that
                        simplifies browsing through the standards. Teachers can easily follow the progress of a standard,
                        from its introduction in the early grades through its more advanced forms in the secondary
                        grades.</p>

                    <h3>TouchMath Plus</h3>
                    <p>In the Touch Math program, from Innovative Learning Concepts, special education and struggling
                        students of all ages build proficiencies with numbers through a system that engages learners on
                        auditory, visual, and tactile/kinesthetic levels. Victory used a set of HTML5 technologies to
                        create a rich web-based front end that offers convenient online access to familiar worksheets
                        and reproducible materials in digital form.</p>

                    <h3>Active Classroom</h3>
                    <p>Active Classroom is an online platform where students can perform sophisticated multidimensional
                        analysis using embedded video and interactive tools in rich, engaging ways. It is based on
                        HTML5 and the latest web standards. It works with iPads, iPhones, and other mobile devices.
                        <br>Teachers choose from a library of materials created by SSSS to cover subject area, era,
                        theme, activity type, text complexity, assessment type, group size, and grade. Victory built
                        a robust LMS that correlates content to CCSS and teacher-selected state standards. It collects,
                        records, and tracks data. Additional interactive tools include Google Maps, Image Examiner, and
                        a video conferencing component.</p>

                    <p>The Virginia Department of Education needed course materials developed to support schools in
                        teaching to a new high school requirement. Victory came to their aid, developing a yearlong
                        course and deploying it online through their statewide LMS. When Apple revealed iBooks
                        Textbooks, Victory leapt to convert the course for use on the iPad, taking full advantage of
                        the format’s interactive capabilities. The resulting pair of iBooks textbooks were the first
                        available on economics and personal finance in the iTunes store.</p>

                    <p>Gale Cengage asked Victory to compile data about the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and present
                        them in a variety of media through one Flash-based learning object. Our solution combines
                        graphs of signal indicators, such as the total of shoreline that was despoiled, and a timeline
                        of events related to the spill. The product incorporates video, slideshows, photos, and links
                        to a variety of sources of news media outlets. Student and class activities focus on data
                        analysis, critical thinking, and writing skills.</p>

                    <p>Norwood House noticed an opportunity to integrate science into the ELA curriculum by providing
                        science readers to support FOSS Science Kits, the leading inquiry-based science program in the
                        United States. Victory’s team for science consulted with NSTA while writing, illustrating,
                        and designing 30 leveled readers that align to the Common Core. Each book starts with a puzzle
                        that kids solve as they think about the information presented in a measured, well-planned
                        sequence.</p>

                    <h3>Project-Based Inquiry Science</h3>
                    <p>Victory collaborated with the editorial team at It’s About Time, a leading provider of
                        STEM-based educational products for grades 6–12. For the Astronomy and Weather SEs,
                        Victory worked closely with the principal investigator/lead author to implement their complex
                        science inquiry model. Additionally, Victory has edited teaching strategies for ELLs and
                        Differentiated Instruction. This project-based system for teaching science is in line with
                        building higher-order thinking skills and encouraging student collaboration, both goals of
                        the Common Core State Standards.</p>

                        In doing so we strive to craft the most beautiful and intuitive user
                        experiences possible.
                        You'll create fast, scalable web architectures using modern standards
                        with a team that takes pride in producing elegant, functional,
                        and well-tested code. We take on a wide range of problems and projects,
                        and as such we're looking for people who have multi-disciplinary interests,
                        and will express their opinions to help craft great experiences.

                        THE HIGHLIGHTS
                        Work closely with UX designers during planning to develop ideas and prototypes.
                        Contribute to peer reviews of code to ensure the highest quality code craftsmanship.
                        Love learning about emerging technologies and standards.
                        Expertise creating web interfaces using Javascript + jQuery, HTML5, and CSS3.
                        Experience working with AJAX, JSON, and REST APIs.

                        BONUS POINTS
                        Experience with frameworks such as Wordpress, Drupal, or Django.
                        Aptitude with popular client-side frameworks (such as Backbone, Sammy, Ember, etc.)
                        Backend development experience in PHP or Python
                        Experience with version control systems.

                        TO APPLY
                        Resumes are nice, but we want to know more than a .doc or .pdf could ever tell us.
                        We want to see the amazing work you’ve been a part of and hear about how you plan to
                        change the future of web applications. What do you love to work on? What excites you
                        about Playground? We look forward to chatting with you.
