                        THE GIG
                        At Playground we are making the next generation of web applications.
                        In doing so we strive to craft the most beautiful and intuitive user
                        experiences possible.
                        You'll create fast, scalable web architectures using modern standards
                        with a team that takes pride in producing elegant, functional,
                        and well-tested code. We take on a wide range of problems and projects,
                        and as such we're looking for people who have multi-disciplinary interests,
                        and will express their opinions to help craft great experiences.

                        THE HIGHLIGHTS
                        Work closely with UX designers during planning to develop ideas and prototypes.
                        Contribute to peer reviews of code to ensure the highest quality code craftsmanship.
                        Love learning about emerging technologies and standards.
                        Expertise creating web interfaces using Javascript + jQuery, HTML5, and CSS3.
                        Experience working with AJAX, JSON, and REST APIs.

                        BONUS POINTS
                        Experience with frameworks such as Wordpress, Drupal, or Django.
                        Aptitude with popular client-side frameworks (such as Backbone, Sammy, Ember, etc.)
                        Backend development experience in PHP or Python
                        Experience with version control systems.

                        TO APPLY
                        Resumes are nice, but we want to know more than a .doc or .pdf could ever tell us.
                        We want to see the amazing work you’ve been a part of and hear about how you plan to
                        change the future of web applications. What do you love to work on? What excites you
                        about Playground? We look forward to chatting with you.
